This is a survaillence system that will run on Sunfounder's ESP32 microcontroller with the camera extension. 

We are programming our ESP32 microcontroller with C to preserve memory.
We will be connecting to Wifi to stream the video live on the private network and capture instances of motion being detected and save them either to an SD card or to some other medium.
